[#03-UTXO]
= UTXO-style Accounting

In order to become proficient with all things Plutus, it is
inevitable that you must first acquire a solid understanding of how
accounting is done on the Cardano platform.

// Perhaps we should just say "UTXO accounting" instead of "UTXO-style accounting"?
// We also sometimes talk about the "UTXO model".
We traditionally think of money transfers as being between two bank accounts,
or perhaps internet addresses in the case of digital currency. The Cardano platform,
like a number of other cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin, instead uses
an accounting approach known as UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) style. A full
formal description of this approach to accounting can be found as part of the Cardano ledger
specification, see <<endmatter#deleg>>.

UTXO-style accounting documents the flow of money not from account to account,
but rather from transaction to transaction. Each transaction has inputs
(where the money being spent is coming from), and outputs
(where this money is going). Note that the body of a transaction may also
contain other data, such as money to be paid in transaction fees. We will
see further extensions when we examine the Extended
UTXO model in the <<09-extended#09-extended>> chapter.

Consider the transaction graph below, <<tx-flow>>. The black lines represent unspent outputs
of transactions, and the red lines represent these outputs being used as inputs
to subsequent transactions. The vertical unlabelled box represents a single
transaction which has several inputs and several outputs. The blue certificates
represent remaining unspent outputs in our illustration.
Note that here, at the start of the transaction graph, Alice has 100 Ada (the primary currency
on the Cardano platform) in
unspent outputs from before the start time of this graph -
this money comes from one or more transactions outside the scope of this picture.
We abstract this with a single box (labelled with her name and the 100 Ada).
This box has two black (output) lines coming out of it, with the total value
of these outputs adding up to 100 Ada):

* a 58 Ada output, which remains unspent and is part of Alice's
final unspent outputs
* a 42 Ada output, which becomes part of the new transaction

Now, Bob has 10 Ada from previous unspent outputs. He spends them as follows:

* all 10 Ada goes to the new transaction

This new transaction has two inputs, 42 from Alice, and 10
from Bob. This transaction has two outputs, 2 Ada to Bob, and 50 to Charlie.
We also see that Charlie has 52 Ada from a previously unspent output, for
a total of 102 Ada he can spend in future transactions. Bob is left with
only one output of 2 Ada, and Alice, a total of 58 Ada in unspent outputs
from other transactions.

// This paragraph is a bit unclear. It's not clear how "an output must be spent
// in full" corresponds to it being immutable, or the connection to account-based bookkeeping.
// The final sentence also doesn't make sense to me.
// Also, you talk about "account-based bookkeeping" and the "ledger", but we haven't exaplained
// what those are.
The above model is strictly showing the flow of currency between several
participants. In this simplified version, the transactions illustrated are not
paying fees, etc.
Even in this model, we see that an output must always be spent
in full. That is, a record of an unspent output cannot be modified (this would
be account-based bookkeeping), only used entirely. In order to maintain
the ledger bookkeeping integrity, the new transaction must have all the unspent outputs (totaling
the correct amount of all the unspent outputs) that are being used up by it.

In the example above, our new transaction uses outputs of value
42 from Alice and 10 from Bob, for a total of 52 Ada. We must then have
52 Ada of outputs from this transaction (2 to Bob and 50 to Charlie).
Note here that Bob had both an output used by this transaction and
an output produced by this transaction. That is, he got
change (of 2 Ada) from this transaction. Since there is no way to spend
part of an output, this is how UTXO accounting deals with partial spending -
by returning excess funds to the user via a "change" output.

// I don't really know what you're trying to say here. The goal of smart contracts is to
// redistribute money?
Notice here that this style of accounting makes it convenient, if not intuitive,
to distribute the flow of cash from several contributors to several recipients by
having it flow into a common pot, i.e. the transaction, before being sent to
the intended payees.
This is, in a very general sense, the goal of smart contracts.

Let us explore what is going on during the processing of a UTXO transaction event more formally.
For the basic transaction model we discuss here, refer to <<utxo-definitions>>.

.Basic UTXO definitions

Before we examine the structure of transactions, let us look at how bookkeeping
is done on the ledger. The record on the ledger that
contains this information is called a UTXO
and denoted `UTXO` in the figure.
This record is a finite map, where the key is a pair of transaction ID and
an index, `TxIn = TxId * Ix`. The transaction ID `TxId`
 can be calculated from a complete transaction
submitted for processing, and is a unique identifier of this transaction.
The index `Ix` is necessary because there may be more than one output,
and each must have a unique identifier within the set of outputs
of a given transaction.
The values in the UTXO finite map are pairs of a coin value and an
address, whose type is `TxOut = Addr * Coin`.
Note that users' addresses are always public keys, and the funds at them
belong to anyone who is able to prove that they possess the corresponding
private key. Script addresses (used in smart contracts) are slightly different, as we will see later.

As for the structure of the transaction itself,
let us examine the outputs first. A single transaction may distribute
the money it is spending to several different addresses.
The outputs (values of type `TxOut`) are stored in a transaction as the values in a finite map.
The keys of the finite map are distinct index values within the context
of the finite map, such that the
combination of a transaction ID and an index will be a globally unique
identifier for the output of a transaction.
In UTXO-style accounting, we relate
output values to the inputs from which they come by means of this composite
global identifier.
// Did you mean: we relate *inputs* to the *outputs* from which they come via the identifier?

The inputs, whose order does not matter, are a set and not a list.
The elements of this set contain neither
a coin value to be spent, nor the address which the money is coming from.
This is the main distinction between traditional accounting and UTXO accounting:
money can only be spent by using a specific unspent output of
a previously processed transaction on the ledger.
Each element of the input sets is a pair of a transaction ID and an index,
which, as explained above, uniquely identifies the unspent output in the UTXO
that is to be spent.

Processing a transaction involves updating the UTXO on the ledger in a way
that makes the funds spent by the transaction being processed available to
be spent by the owners of the addresses listed in the outputs. That is,
all the entries corresponding to the inputs of the processed transaction are
removed from the ledger UTXO. Additionally, all the `TxOut` values in
the finite map of the outputs of the transaction are added to the UTXO,
with the key of the finite map consisting of the ID of the transaction being processed,
and the index value the same as in the finite map of outputs of this transaction.
That is, if `tx` contains a pair of a set of inputs and a finite map
of outputs `(ins, outs)` with ID `id`, and
`ix |-> (a,c)` is an entry in `outs`, the UTXO will
have the entry `(id, ix) |-> (a,c)` added. Here, we use the notation `k |-> v`
to refer to an entry in a finite map which has the key `k` and the value `v`.

// This remark seems slightly out of place.
Now, we would like to capture this update concisely in terms of mathematical
notation (which is rather human-readable), but this can also be translated directly into
code. We will continue to use this notation in our explanation of
the inclusion of Plutus scripts inside transactions as well.

The following
definitions are three ways to filter a UTXO finite map. The first one is
filtering the UTXO by a subset `ins` of the keys. The second filter
gives the complement of the result of the first filter (i.e. all the UTXO
entries not indexed by keys in the list of inputs). The third filter
filters UTXO entries by the values.

// It sounds a bit odd to say we're using the *notation* to process a transaction.
// Perhaps you mean these *functions*?
We would like to use this notation to process a new transaction. That is,
remove the spent outputs, and build the
set of new outputs a transaction is adding to the UTXO (as we described above).
We may compute the outputs as follows:

image::outputs.png[]

Using this notation, we can define the UTXO update due to a transaction
`tx` as follows:

image::utxoupd.png[]

Note that an explicit calculation of the total amount of Ada in the outputs and
the total Ada in all the inputs of a transaction must be performed as part of
validating a transaction. There are destinations for the Ada being spent in the inputs
besides flowing into transaction outputs. The main one is the treasury, which is kept
track of as a global value on the ledger. Transaction fees and
deposits are paid into the treasury, for example. There could also be output entries
in a transaction without
corresponding inputs - these are due to collecting rewards from reward
addresses.
// The last sentence sounds like you're saying that outputs normally have to correspond to
// an input. I think what you're saying is that there could be outputs even if there are *no*
// inputs.

// *What* is the generalized accounting property? Something we're not going to talk about? This
// paragraph is confusing.
// "Other accounts on the ledger"? I thought we weren't doing account-based bookkeeping!
Now, in order to validate a transaction, there are a number of
calculations performed involving the Ada in the transaction and the Ada
in other accounts on the ledger to make sure Ada is neither created nor destroyed,
so to say. This is known as the _generalized accounting property_.
The UTXO accounting scheme provides built-in protection against double spending
of a given output.
This inherent protection, together with the enforcement of the generalized
accounting property,
ensures that no dishonest spending is allowed to occur. This is a crucial property
of the Cardano ledger bookkeeping system, in particular because there is a
set amount of Ada in existence, which can never change. Note that _not all_
Ada in existence is in circulation at all times. Much of it is stored as
_reserves_, and slowly enters circulation through the process of awarding
monetary rewards to stakeholders over time.
The interested reader can look up the details of this process in <<endmatter#deleg>>.

Note also that a transaction includes a host of other data, such as
witnesses, certificates, and scripts along with their hashes.
Here we have not gone into the details of the specific types and calculations
used in the Cardano ledger implementation, but you should now have a
sufficient understanding of the structure of a transaction and how it is
processed to be able to understand what goes on behind the
scenes when Plutus code is used to generate a transaction.
