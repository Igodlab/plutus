= Extended UTXO Model

// Odd to say that we're introducing readers to the idea of using scripts
// as smart contracts here... don't we do that in many other places?
This chapter is geared towards the reader that wants to have a clearer picture
of just where Plutus fits in to the Cardano ledger.
Here we present a high-level explanation of the Extended
UTXO model used in Cardano and introduce the reader to the idea of using scripts as
tools for making smart contracts on the blockchain. In this chapter,
we build on concepts and notation from the <<03-UTXw#03-UTXO>> chapter.

The basic UTXO model is adequate for accounting for transactions using Ada, but little more.
The extended UTXO model brings a significant portion of the expressiveness of
Ethereumâ€™s account-based scripting model to the UTXO-based Cardano ledger,
including smart contract support.
The extension has two components:

. An extension to the data carried by transactions and the validation performed by the nodes
. An extension to the data stored in the chain UTXO
. An extension to the wallet backend to facilitate off-chain code that coordinates
the execution of on-chain computations

In this chapter, we focus on the first component.
In the extended UTXO model, additional on-chain computations must be done to
validate a transaction. Without scripts, the ledger UTXO state update
rule essentially consists of two steps (both of which are, of course, computations
performed by nodes, and are on-chain):

. Check that a transaction is valid, which includes verifying the following:
* it is live (the transactions time to live has not passed yet)
* the Ada values being spent are non-negative
* generalized accounting property holds
* the size of the transaction does not exceed the maximum
* the fee is being paid
* etc.

// I would skip all the stuff about staking, delegation, genesis etc. It's unrelated
// to this section and never explained, so I think it's just confusing. Besides,
// I think it's important that extended UTXO is orthogonal to all the staking stuff.
. Check that the every action the transaction is performing is witnessed
by the holder of the appropriate private key for
* the spending of every output (witnessed by the key holder for the address
from which the funds are being spent)
* claiming of rewards (witnessed by the holder of the staking key for
the reward address)
* the application of every certificate (witnessed by certificate author)
* genesis key delegations

NOTE: For a detailed formal description of the ledger model, we refer the reader again to <<endmatter#deleg>>.

A major way to extend the functionality of the Cardano ledger is by adding
script capability to the second step.

== Scripts
// This whole section is quite confusing. There are a lot of concepts but it feels like
// they're introduced in an odd order. Frequently the text assumes that people know things
// it hasn't explained yet. For example, nowhere in this section do we say that scripts
// are attached to inputs!

// I probably wouldn't even mention Plutus Tx here - you're trying to explain the
// ledger part of this, all the Haskell stuff is a distraction.
Recall from the <<10-PlutusTx#10-PlutusTx>> chapter that
scripts are Plutus Core expressions carried by
a transaction. They are defined inside a specially-delimited
sections of a Haskell program, called Plutus Tx, which are then compiled into
Plutus Core.

// You've said this several times already.
Scripts are a way to add smart contract functionality
to the extended UTXO model.
Many of the subsequent chapters of this book discuss building scripts
that define specific smart contracts. In this section, however,
we discuss in general how scripts are used in the extended UTXO model.

NOTE: For a draft of the formal specification of the extended UTXO model with
scripts, see <<endmatter#scripts>>.

Scripts, like witnesses, are another
tool to make sure a transaction only performs authorized actions.
The purpose of witnessing for (non-script) spending of outputs is to verify
that the wallet spending the output has the private key associated with the address
in the corresponding UTXO entry (i.e. the address from which it is spending the
money) by checking that it was indeed signed (witnessed)
by that key.

// What is this `Addr_script` type?
// This paragraph is confusing. It sounds like you're talking about the key thing that
// scripts do, but in many ways this is an implementation detail (we could perfectly
// well put scripts themselves on outputs, rather than their hashes).
A script `s {two-colons} Script` has its own address
`a {two-colons} Addr_script`, to which it
is possible to pay. This script address is the hash of the script.
Thus, for scripts, we want to check that a transaction (and the wallet that
generated it) has the original script of which this address is the hash.
The whole validator script itself is never stored on the ledger, only its hash,
and only as the address of the unspent UTXO entries belonging to that script.

The role of a script is not to generate additional inputs or outputs in
the current transaction (or make new transactions). Scripts are only used to
verify that if a given transaction is consuming an unspent
output, it is allowed to do so. This script locking approach is only
relevant to those outputs in the UTXO which are associated with a script
address, meaning that these outputs
belong to a script.

// This is hard to follow in prose. I'd pick a simpler example. What about multisig?
For example, recall the crowdfunding campaign scheme. If it is time for
the owner of the campaign to collect the contributions, his wallet
should produce a transaction with inputs which correspond to the contributions of the
funders (i.e. the entries in the ledger UTXO which have the script address of that
crowdfunding contract in the `Addr` field). The outputs of
this transaction must be totaling the same amount as the contributors'
inputs plus the transaction fee, presumably with the owner's own address in the
`Addr` field of each.
The purpose of the scripts carried by such a transaction would be to prove that
this consumption of UTXO entries is authorized, e.g. the campaign goal has
been reached and in this current interval of time, the owner is allowed to
collect the contributions.

// This is odd. We're explaining the basics of fees (which should probably be done
// elsewhere), but we don't mention the script-specific bit, which is that users
// have to pay for execution costs. The part about pre-computing fees is very
// relevant, though.
The wallet is expected to compute the fees and either add them to the inputs, or
subtract them from the outputs if possible. The exact behaviour should be
configurable by the user. Note that changing the inputs and outputs affects the
transaction fees. Note also, however, that the fee can always be pre-computed
and paid in full, since a script-carrying transaction comes with all
the inputs, outputs, and other data that is needed to validate it. Thus,
there is never a problem of a transaction fee being insufficient.

Here we must note that several pieces of data
go into authorizing the spending of an output with
this script, including
the validator script, redeemer script, data script, and the datatype of the
contract, etc. These are very important features of Plutus and are the
tools that make it possible to perform contract state-dependent validation.
We will discuss the role of each of these in following section, as well as
explain the use of each in every example we present later on.

== Validator, Redeemer, and Data Scripts
// I think this section gets too bogged down in concrete details, especially referencing
// the actual functions and datatypes that we use! I think this makes it *much* more complicated
// than it needs to be, and it would be better to give a more conceptual explanation.

A a term of type `Script` is a Plutus Core expression.
Validator scripts are Plutus Core functions that take several input
arguments (which are also scripts). In order to apply one script to
another, we use the function

`applyScript :: Script -> Script -> Script`

This application is also typechecked during validation.
Let us now look at the function of validator
scripts and their arguments on the blockchain.

. Validator script
* Carried by a transaction input spending funds from a script address
* Not stored in full in the ledger UTXO
- only the hash is stored as the address of
the output to which the carrying transaction pays
* Is a function taking the following 3 types of scripts as parameters
- data script
- redeemer script
- transaction data
* returns a boolean, `False` if validation fails, `True` otherwise

. Data script
* Carried by a transaction output which is paying to a script
* Can be used to carry state information about a given smart contract, e.g.
- the public key of the contributor of a crowdfunding campaign, or
- the hash of the word participants must guess to win money locked by the contract
* Stored in full in the UTXO
- each output belonging to a (validator) script address must have an associated data script
// I don't think this is true? Or what would it be used for?
* Hash computed as part of transaction validation

[start=3]
. Redeemer script
* Carried by a transaction input which is spending funds from a script address
* A piece of information the wallet must provide in order for a
transaction to spend from a
script address,
* Can represent an action, such as a
- guessing a secret word (the guess can be verified using the _data_ script)
- an input command which is interpreted by the validator
as spending money from a script (this changes the data script of the contract)
* Value is never stored on-chain, and only appears as part of transaction data
// Again, I don't think we ever hash this, why would we?
* Hash computed if and when it is necessary for script validation, not stored on-chain

Another argument that the validator script takes is information about the transaction

[start=4]
. A `PendingTx` value.
* Contains information about the current transaction
- inputs and outputs
- validity interval, etc.

The following function is used to perform the validation (i.e. apply the
validator to the relevant inputs) using the
scripts described above:

----
runScript
    :: (MonadError ScriptError m)
    => Checking
    -> ValidationData
    -- ^ contains the PendingTx data
    -> DataScripts
    -- ^ a list of data scripts that may be used in the validation computation
    -- ^ more on these in the note below
    -> ValidatorScript
    -- ^ the validator
    -> DataScript
    -- ^ the specific data script locking the input for which the validation is being performed
    -> RedeemerScript
    -- ^ the redeemer
    -> m [String]
----

We will explain the purpose of the argument of type `DataScripts` in the note below.
These are data scripts that are associated with script addresses the carrying
transaction is paying _to_.
Now, let us look more closely at how these scripts fit into the extended model
transaction and UTXO structure.

Recall that in the classic model, UTXO entries are of the form
`(txid, ix) |-> (a,c)`. The pair `(a,c)` has type `TxOut` and is called an output,
where `a` is the address of the owner of the funds
(the paying or staking public key, usually), and `c` is the value of Ada in the output.

// This explanation for why the data script must be stored in full doesn't actually
// explain it - the same statement is true of the redeemer script.
For the extended model, we say that an output is locked by (or belongs to)
a script if `a` is a script address (hash of the validator script). In this
case, we must store additional data on the
ledger in the `TxOut` - the data script. It must be stored in full, not just the
hash, since it will be passed as an argument to the validator during
validation of a transaction which is trying to spend this output.
The extended `TxOut` for a script address contains

- an address `a`, which is the hash of the validator
- the value `c` of funds at this address
// I don't know what this is trying to say
- the type of the output, and the data script, expressed as `PayToScript datascript`:

A `TxOut` which belongs to a public key address contains only the address and the value.
Thus, a term of the `TxOut` data structure type includes a term of the type:

----
data TxOutType =
    PayToScript !DataScript -- A pay-to-script output with the given data script.
    | PayToPubKey !PubKey -- A pay-to-pubkey output.
----

This is how the outputs are structured both inside the carrying transaction
and the UTXO.

In the extended model, the position of an output in the outputs list
carried by a transaction is its reference index `ix`.
In the UTXO, the outputs are stored as a finite
map with the keys of the form `(txid, ix)`. Once a transaction is validated,
the update mechanism
of the UTXO is the same for both the the extended and classic model (with the
extended model storing the additional `TxOutType` data described above).
For a reminder, see the <<03-UTXO#03-UTXO>> chapter.

In the classic model, the inputs of a transaction are simply references to
the UTXO entries which the transaction is spending, so they are
of the form `(txid, ix)` - just like the keys of the UTXO finite map.
In the extended model, we call this pair
`TxOutRef` in the code, and it makes up only a part of the `TxIn`.
Additionally, for an `TxOutRef` which references a script address (i.e. is
spending from a script), the full validator and redeemer script must be included
in the `TxIn` data. So, in the `TxIn` data type, we add a term of the following
type:

----
data TxInType =
      ConsumeScriptAddress !ValidatorScript !RedeemerScript
    -- ^ A transaction input that consumes a script address with the given validator and redeemer pair.
    | ConsumePublicKeyAddress !PubKey
    -- ^ A transaction input that consumes a public key address.
----

To recap the paying and spending process in a different way,

. Paying to a script address
* Transaction contains an output `o` where the address in it is the hash of the
validator script
- this hash is computed off-chain by the wallet
* `o` also contains the corresponding data script
* `o` becomes a value in the UTXO map once the carrying transaction is processed
* No validation occurs
- Neither the full validator nor the redeemer are part of this payment process

. Spending from a script address
* Transaction contains an input `i` which
- references the output in the UTXO it is spending
- contains the full validator and redeemer scripts
* The UTXO entry which `i` references is a script address, and thus has a
data script stored in the output
- the validator script `i` provides must hash to this script address
* Validation is done at this point for the spending of the specific output
`i` references
- we have the validator, redeemer and data script all available
- if it succeeds, the transaction is allowed to spend the UTXO output `i` references
- validation is performed on-chain

If the `runScript` computation returns true for a specific output being spent,
the validation process proceeds.
Otherwise, the entire transaction is scrapped. Essentially, given the context
of the ledger state and carrying transaction data,
the validator is used to show that the provided action (redeemer), is allowed
to be performed given the current contract state (data script).
In other words, the smart
contract functionality defined by the code in the validator allows the spending
of script-owned output funds by the carrying transaction.
Note that,
in the spirit of UTXO style accounting, the contract state is never updated in
the UTXO entry. One can only spend that entry, and create a new one with a
different data script.

// Sealing is not mentioned above
We now go on to explain the sealing mechanism mentioned above
as it is currently implemented on the Plutus mockchain. Its
purpose is to add additional functionality to the script model, but
implementation places different requirements on the type of the redeemer script as
a consequence. We will see how to build redeemer scripts that conform to
these in the upcoming chapters discussing concrete examples.

.The Seal Mechanism
[NOTE]
====

// This sentence is hard to parse
Having access to the data scripts of a script address a transaction
is paying _to_ for the purposes of validation significantly expands the expressivity
of the validator-redeemer-data script model for locking outputs.
This additional functionality is useful when two or more contracts
interact, where both contracts have some resources that they need to control
across a chain of transactions.

In such cases, the types of the data scripts
associated with a script address to which a transaction is paying
are arbitrary and not necessarily known ahead of time. This does not impact
the `PendingTx` representation of the transaction, as it stores all the data
scripts opaquely as `DataScript`s,
but without knowing the underlying Plutus Core types of these terms,
adding such functionality creates a typing
challenge for performing Plutus Core computations in the validation process.

// This is a pretty tricky topic. I think you would be much better off leading
// with a real example, which would be easier for people to think about. You
// could also use that to motivate the need to look at the data scripts in the
// first place - at the moment you just have abstractly said it makes things
// "more powerful".
Suppose there is a UTXO entry on the ledger with the validator script hash
address `v1`, and the associated data script `ds1`. If a transaction `t` is
trying to spend this entry and move the funds to an address `v2` of a
different validator script, but produce multiple outputs for this,
locked with different data scripts. For example, it wants to create two outputs
in the UTXO with data scripts `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2` (at the address `v2`).

Now, in order to spend the funds at script address `v1`, our transaction `t` must
provide the validator that hashes to `v1`, along with the redeemer. Suppose
we want the validation result to depend on the contents of
the data scripts of the script outputs to which a transaction is paying (as well as
likely their script address as well).

In our example, this means that whether `t` is validated or not will depend
on `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2`.
The validator which hashes to `v1` cannot know ahead of time the real types of the
Plutus Core terms hiding inside the two data scripts, since `v1` was defined
prior to `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2` being defined. Thus, we must find
a way to have access to these during validation without being explicit about their
types anywhere in the code of the validator (which hashes to `v1`).

Now, the data script at `v1` is predefined and does not know anything about the
types of `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2` either. The `PendingTx` argument has a set type
as well. The redeemer `r1`, however, is a piece of Plutus Core code we can work
with to navigate this typing issue. It is carried by `t`, which is built
by off-chain code in a wallet. As part of building `t`, this off-chain code
defines both the redeemer `r1`
for the validator with script address `v1` and also the data scripts
`v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2` for script address `v2`. So this code _can_ have access to
the information about the data scripts' types.

Let us see how we can make use of these unpredictably typed scripts in the
`runScript` validation by defining the redeemer in a special way.
Recall that `runScript` has an argument of type `DataScripts`. This
is how the data scripts are passed, `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2` in our example.
The function `runScript` _seals_ these data scripts using

----
newtype Sealer = Sealer (forall a . a -> DataScriptHash -> Sealed (HashedDataScript a))
----

For the moment, ignore the hashing of the data script - we will elabourate
on this below.
The resulting terms are then
passed to the redeemer script `r1`, which in our example would have the
underlying type

----
Sealed (HashedDataScript t1) -> Sealed (HashedDataScript t2) -> r
----

Here, `t1` and `t2` correspond to the underlying types of `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2`.
The redeemer is defined to have the type above by the same wallet that also
defined `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2`, so it is aware of `t1` and `t2`. The redeemer
is also defined to be in charge of performing
any relevant computations involving the two data scripts. In most
simpler contract examples, the redeemer simply throws them away because
the data scripts of the script address
the funds are being paid to are irrelevant during validation for the purposes
of the contract.

We do not actually pass the two argument function `r1` directly to the
validator - the types would not make sense. Instead, we apply this function
to the sealed data scripts, and pass an argument of type `r` (i.e. the
type of an `appliedRedeemer`) to the validator `v1` instead. This type `r` is
fixed when the validator `v1` is defined, but we have the freedom to choose
the (necessarily `Sealed`) hashed data script argument types of the full redeemer.
Next, the following computation is performed as part of the validation, which
is done inside `runScript`. It is the centerpiece of the script validation model,
where the validator is applied to the (applied) redeemer, data script, and `PendingTx`,

----
((v1 `applyScript` ds1) `applyScript` appliedRedeemer) `applyScript` valData
----

Because the redeemer `r1` is untrusted, but we rely on it to compute with
or simply forward the data inside `v2_ds1` and `v2_ds2` to the validator `v1`,
we have a problem.
This is where the `HashedDataScript` comes in. The hash of a data script
is part of the sealed value, and the data scripts themselves are part of the transaction
data of `t`. So, the validator
can check (by comparing hashes) that it is being passed the sealed values that do indeed correspond
to the data scripts in the outputs of `t`, and the redeemer did not swap them.

====


// These sentences seem unrelated? Also, in the future it may be that transactions
// whose scripts fail may still pay fees, but this isn't decided yet.
Note that with this model, as with the classic UTXO
model, a transaction which was not validated does not incur fees. Unlike
the classic model, however, the extended model allows for spending from script
addresses that do not belong to the wallet that generated the transaction.
This is because instead of a private key, a validator script must be
provided to spend from such an address, and scripts are publicly available.

// Why is this in this section? It seems unrelated.
The reader will also note later on, as we discuss writing a complete Plutus contract,
the off-chain function that returns a PlutusTx validator script takes a parameter.
This parameter is of a different type for each kind of contract. For example,
it will be a term of type `Campaign` for a crowdfunder contract:

`contributionScript {two-colons} Campaign -> ValidatorScript`

This parameter for any kind of contract is a
data structure containing necessary non-state, immutable data about the contract
(e.g. the public key of the owner of the campaign).
The values passed to the validator via this data structure parameter are not only used in
defining some of the contract's functions within
the validator, but they serve to uniquely identify a specific contract (e.g. a
specific crowdfunding campaign or guessing game).
Generally, it is a good idea to define the type of this state-less contract
structure parameter in such a way that it necessarily makes the resulting
contract unique, thus making its validator-hash address unique also.
Then the user is able to, for example, pay exactly to the instance of the
crowdfunder they intended, and not accidentally end up with top hat instead of
a Plutus textbook!

== Additional Extended Model Notes

=== Sharing Plutus Code

The off-chain code, explored in detail in
the next chapter, is run by the users' wallet (or, in the Playground simulation,
the mock wallet). The main goal of the off-chain code is to generate
the correct script at the correct time and to build a transaction carrying it.

Recall that Plutus Playground is a platform where one can write on- and off-chain code
to simulate smart contract functionality on
the mockchain. All the code written in the Playground
is shared by the mock wallets during the simulation, and can be used by
any of them.
In the real Cardano blockchain environment, on- and off-chain
contract code is meant to be used by all wallets participating in the contract,
distributed over the network. This means there needs to be another reliable way
to share Plutus code. The on-chain code is hashed, and the hash is stored in the
UTXO, giving the participants a way to verify that it is indeed the right code
for the right contract. The off-chain code is simply a way to generate
scripts and transactions, which then get validated and authenticated as
part of transaction processing. Thus, it is not necessary to use the blockchain to
provide additional guarantees of its authenticity - simply sharing such code
via a reliable code repository like GitHub will suffice.

However, similar to the case of legal know-how being necessary to write and
understand legal contracts, it is up to the creators and users of a smart contract
to have sufficient understanding of Plutus code to trust the contract is doing
what they expect it to do. Cryptographic security is powerless in this case -
this is where this book comes in!

=== Rollbacks and Other Extended UTXO Model Considerations

Given that blockchain events, such as the confirmation of a transaction, can
trigger the execution of off-chain coordination code, we need to carefully
consider the implications of needing to rollback any action that depends on a
rolled back transaction. We do not give the details of this functionality here.

There are other features of the extended UTXO system that are less relevant to
a Plutus user, which we will also not explain in detail in this chapter.

=== Adding Ledger Functionality Using Scripts

In the upcoming examples in this book we walk the reader through the process
of building, testing and using Plutus contracts. For examples of work on using
scripts to add specific functionality to the UTXO ledger, we would like to
point the reader to the following documents,

* Multi-currency on the UTXO Ledger, see <<endmatter#multicur>>
- An implementation of a script-based model for different types of
currency as well as non-fungible tokens on the mockchain

- A formal specification of enforcing a custom witnessing policy for spending
outputs
