{- Note [Serialisation and hashing]

We use cryptonite for generating hashes, which requires us to serialise values
to a strict ByteString (to implement `Data.ByteArray.ByteArrayAccess`).

Binary serialisation could be achieved via

1. The `binary` package
2. The `cbor` package

(1) is used in the cardano-sl repository, and (2) is used in the
`language-plutus-core` project in this repository.

In this module we use (2) because of the precedent. This means however that we
may generate different hashes for the same transactions compared to cardano-sl.
This might become a problem if/when we want to support "imports" of some real
blockchain state into the emulator.

However, it should be easy to change the serialisation mechanism later on,
especially because we only need one direction (to binary).
