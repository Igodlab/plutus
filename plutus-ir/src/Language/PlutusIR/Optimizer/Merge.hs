{- Note [Merging lets]
We can merge independent, non-recursive, let bindings together into a single let binding, which is
nice since it reduces the nesting of the program.

We can *nearly* do this by just looking at the dependency graph and constructing level sets. However,
nodes in the same level set may not be mergeable if their let bindings are not adjacent.

So as it stands we need to traverse the term manually, performing local merging.

                Look for the nodes which depend on the bindings defined in this let.

                Logically this should be the *reachable* set. However, given that we're already topologically
                ordered, the only way there can be a transitive dependency between two adjacent nodes is if
                there is a direct dependency. To see this, suppose that there were a transitive dependency
                A -> B -> C, but A and C are adjacent. This is impossible, since B must come between A and C
                in a topological ordering.
